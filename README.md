# ProjectClass

This Java program allows users to create Projects with or without a name and description. Then, using the predefined getters and 
setters, users can change the name or description of their Project as well as present both name and description using the **elevatorPitch()** 
method. The test file goes over the different ways a Project can be instantiated (With or without a name and description, or with only a name 
but no description) as well as showcases the functionality of the getters and setters.
